A simple cross platform mod manager for Risk Of Rain 2 - using Thunderstorm.

## Features
 - Cross platform! You'll have to compile yourself on Windows however there should be a windows release very soon.
 - Easily share modpacks!
    You can export and import mod lists, this feature needs to be fleshed out but for now it means you can generate 
    one text file and easily share it with your friends/teammates to make sure you all have the same mods installed
 - Copy your mods list!
    Paste is currently WIP but rather than export you can just click copy, paste your list in Discord or wherever
    and save yourself the hassle of uploading a file.
    Unfortunately you still need to create a file to import.

## Coming soon
 - Working copy/paste
 - Add search
 - Proper mod version control
 - Pick filename for mod list
